AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)

	- Helps to implement Cross Cutting Concerns
	- e.g. Logging, Transaction Mgmt, Security, etc..

	Aspect - logging

	Advise - piece of code or logic to be executed
		- Before
		- After
		- AfterReturn
		- AfterThrow
		- Around

	Joint Point - point where advise needs to be executed
	Point Cut - set of joint points where advise be applied
	Interceptor - aspect with single advise
